This software implements a computational approach that enables threading of a protein sequence to a particular structure, in the most stable way, using dynamic programing with cost function based on some known data, basic physical properties and other heuristics.
The structure is left hand beta helical (LHBH) structure, a structure suspected of facilitating abnormal aggregation and creation of fibrils associated with prion diseases. My computational algorithm does not try to directly simulate the physical forces nor is it based on bioinformatics data rather I use a physical motivated energy function to evaluate structure viability and thus allow fast protein structure prediction. Other computational tools, available at the time I wrote this code, are either ineffective (they reproduce the normal structure, rather testing the abnormal one) or too slow for such tasks.
